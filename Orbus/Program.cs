/**********************************************************************************
This coding task aims to explore your programming knowledge from the
perspective of the SOLID principles and how you'd apply them to existing
code. 

We want you to demonstrate how you would improve the code. We would like to see a 
new sample of code clearly annotated with what you have changed and the reasons 
for the change.

It's important to note that this code isn't designed to run in any meaningful
way, so please do not spend time trying to get it to work. We do expect you to
submit code that compiles though.
